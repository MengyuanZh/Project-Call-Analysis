# Project-Call-Analysis

# Description
New York City publishes a number of open datasets for public consumption or use. Amongst them is a dataset consisting of calls to the 311 phone number for non-emergency services. Each call to 311 has a number of data points tracked and aggregated. We work with a yearâ€™s worth of data from this dataset.

The first Jupyter notebook, Top10.ipynb, analyzes what the top 10 causes of calls to 311 are in our chosen ZIP code 10027, and returns a pandas series reporting a list of the cause, with the number of calls made relating to that particular cause.

The second Jupyter notebook, Parking.ipynb, analyzes whether illegal parking incidents are a larger fraction of total 311 incidents in our ZIP code 10027 than they are in general. We compute the total number of parking incidents in the chosen ZIP code 10027, and the total number of all incidents. Each of the figures are divided by the total number of incidents in the respected area. Results of calculations are compared to assign correct value to the variable higher_parking_proportion.
